class Solution:

        # Time Complexity: O(m + n) 
        # Reasoning: We iterate through both word1 and word2 once, appending 
        # their characters to the result list.
        # m = length of word1, n = length of word2
        
        # Space Complexity: O(m + n)
        # Reasoning: The result list stores the combined characters of word1 and word2,  
        # requiring O(m + n) space.

        # Step 1: Initialize two pointers for word1 and word2.
        i,j = 0,0
        # Step 2: Initialize the result list to store characters alternately.

        #We will be using an iterative while loop which will run
        #according to the condition that i<len(word1) and j<len(word2)
        #We will be using these two pointers to point to each char individually 
        #So we can insert/append to our result array each character alernately

            result.append(word2[j])
            i+=1
            j+=1
        
        #It could be the case that either word1 or word2 still have some characters
        #that needs to be appended to our reuslt. So we will be keep adding any leftovers  
        #chars
        #Adding any remaining chars from word1 (if there are any)
        if i<len(word1):
            result.append(word1[i:])
        #Adding any remaining chars from word2 (if there are any)
        if j<len(word2):
            result.append(word2[j:])

        #To convert our array into a string.
