#In this problem, we are tasked with converting a Roman numeral into an integer.
#We will take advantage of a dictionary to map each Roman numeral to its integer equivalent 
# and perform the appropriate operations accordingly
# When calculating Roman numerals, it is pivotal to understand that if a smaller value is placed before a larger one,
#  it means it needs to be subtracted from the larger one.
# We will use our indices iand  i + 1 i+1 to handle this accordingly.

class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        #First we initialize our dictionary by mapping each roman numerals to integers
        hashmap = {'I':1, 'V':5, 'X':10, 'L':50, 'C':100, 'D': 500, 'M':1000}
        #Declaring our total
        total = 0
        n = len(s)
        i = 0
        #Iterating with a while loop over the 's' and checked by using our hashmaps
        #the respective roman numerals integer values and proceeded with either adding  
        # or subtracting accordingly.
        #We also moved by index +2 in case we performed a subtraction
        #We instead moved our index by 1 in case we just performed an addition
        #O(n)
        while(i<n):
            if i + 1 < n and hashmap[s[i]] < hashmap[s[i+1]]:
                total += hashmap[s[i+1]] - hashmap[s[i]]
                i +=2
            else:
                total += hashmap[s[i]]
                i+=1
        #Finally the total gets returned
        #Time Complexity: O(n)
        #Space Complexity: O(n)
        return total
