"""1347. Minimun number of steps to make two strings anagram"""
# The goal is to calculate the minimum number of steps required to make `t` an anagram of `s`.
# We will achieve this by counting the frequency of characters in both strings
# and determining the difference in character counts that need to be adjusted.
